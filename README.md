# Criminal Face Identification System
Criminal Face Identification System using java and jsp

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:
        This project is aimed to identify the criminals in any investigation department. Here the technique is we already store some images of the criminals in our database along with his details and that images are segmented into many slices say eyes, hairs, lips, nose, etc. These images are again stored in another database record so to identify any criminals; eyewitnesses will see the images or slices that appear on the screen by using it we develop the face, which may or may not be matched with our images. If any image is matched up to 99% then we predict that he is only the criminal. Thus using this project it provides a very friendly environment for both operator and eyewitness to easily design any face can identify criminals very easy. 
	
PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
 	This project is intended to identify a person using the images previously taken. The identification will be done according the previous images of different persons. 
  
PROJECT SCOPE:
  	 The scope of the project is confined to store the image and store in the database. When a person has to be identified the images stored in the database are compared with the existing details.

PROBLEM AREA DESCRIPTION
                         The project is aimed at identifying the criminals with the help of eye witness. There are mainly four modules in our project. They are Adding, Deleting, Updating and identifying the criminals. There are mainly three roles in our project. They are:
	Administrator
	Operator    
	Eyewitness
                        The administrator is responsible for providing User id’s and passwords. He provides authentication to the users. He creates deletes and Updates the User ids and Passwords. 
                        The operator, who belongs to the investigating department, is responsible for entering the criminal details and maintains them. He adds, deletes and updates the criminal details. He also constructs the criminal face with the help of eye witness.
                        The eyewitness identifies the criminals with the help of cropped parts stored in a different database by the operator. The eyewitness selects a cropped part from the database and that cropped part will be freeze by the operator  in this way, complete face of the criminal is constructed and the details of that criminal is retrieved from the database. We can also construct a new image from those cropped parts which we consider as an imaginary face of the criminal.
